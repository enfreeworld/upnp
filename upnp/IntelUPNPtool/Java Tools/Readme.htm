<h1><b>Intel  Tools for UPnP Technologies - Java Edition</b></h1>

<p>There tools are build on the JDK 1.3. On windows, make sure to edit and 
modify the &quot;.bat&quot; files to point to the location of the JVM on the machine, or 
remove the path if the JVM is already in the system path. Also make sure the JVM 
as access to the following 3 files in the class path:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><b><font size="4">xalan.jar, jaxp.jar, crimson.jar</font></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There files are available on the SUN java web site. If there files are not 
present, the Tools will run, but the stack will not function and no device will 
show up in Intel Device Spy and only few packets will show up in Intel Device 
Sniffer.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Intel Device Spy</b> - is the premier Universal Plug &amp; Play Universal 
Control Point (UCP). It allows UPnP device detection, display of detailed 
information on every aspect of a UPnP device and easy to use action invocation.</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Sniffer</b> - monitors all UPnP broadcast traffic on the 
network. Solving SSDP interoperation problems has never been easier. Very useful for  plug fests events. </p>
<p><b>Intel Network Light</b> -  a simple 
home automation light that can be used to demonstrate the basic abilities of 
both Device Spy and Device Sniffer. </p>

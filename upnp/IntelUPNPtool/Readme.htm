<h1><b>Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies</b></h1>

<p>This package is provided as-is, without support and without any guaranties. 
It is not an official Intel product, so please don't call Intel support. We 
appreciate feedback on the tools, especially in relation to interoperability 
issues.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: </b></font>Intel Tools .EXE's are not Win32 applications, they are .NET binaries and 
require <b>Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1</b> to be installed. The .NET Framework 
is available from the Microsoft windows update web site.</p>

<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>

<p>The older version of the Intel Tools worked, but this new version does not. 
What is the problem?</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version of the Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies requires the 
  Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 which is available on the Microsoft Windows 
  update web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am having problems making the Intel Tools run, what could be the problem?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that you have the Microsoft .NET Framework installed. It is 
  available on the Microsoft Windows Update site at
  <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Check that you are running the Tools on a local drive. Microsoft .NET will 
  not allow the Intel Tools to run off of a shared drive for security raisons.</li>
  <li>Make sure not to mix .DLL and .EXE files for different versions of the 
  tools. A given tool will refuse to run is any .DLL in the same directory is 
  not of the correct version.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am new to UPnP, how to a get started?</p>
<ul>
  <li>We recommend starting with Intel Device Spy and Intel Network Light. The 
  light is a small home automation device and Intel Device Spy is a universal 
  control point that can find the light device. It is also recommended to follow 
  the online <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/UPnP/tutorial.htm">
  tutorial videos</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see any UPnP device show up in Device Spy or other Intel Tools?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Intel Tools require a fully running network interface to run properly. 
  Typically, the Intel Tools require that the computer be connected to a local 
  network. A way to check this is to run &quot;IPCONFIG&quot; in the Windows command 
  prompt and make sure at least one interface is configured with a correct IP 
  address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any way to run the Intel Tools correctly without an attached 
network?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes, this if very useful for doing presentations on a laptop or for 
  running the tools on a computer without a attached network. The Microsoft 
  Loopback Adapter Driver can be installed on Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft 
  Windows 2000.</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/Q236/8/69.ASP&NoWebContent=1">
HOW TO: Install Microsoft Loopback Adapter in Windows 2000</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Once the loop back adapter is installed, both Microsoft Windows XP and 
  Microsoft Windows 2000 will take about 30 seconds with self-assign an IP 
  address. The Intel Tools will only work after the adapter as assigned an IP 
  address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where do a get the latest version of the Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The latest version of the Intel Tools and Intel Authoring Tools for UPnP 
  Technologies are available on the Intel UPnP web site at:</li>

<p>Included in this package:</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Spy</b> - is the premier Universal Plug &amp; Play Universal 
Control Point (UCP). It allows UPnP device detection, display of detailed 
information on every aspect of a UPnP device, action invocation, event 
monitoring and error handling. The application is built with a solid, easy to 
use, user interface and leverages Intel's Universal Plug &amp; Play CLR stack.</p>
<p><b>Intel Service Author</b> - is an easy to use SCPD XML authoring tool. 
Creating and maintaining UPnP services is now extremely simple, our SCDP 
parser will also generate and validate the document for compliance. Service 
Author includes a C# code generator, this feature is not useful 
  outside of Intel.</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Sniffer</b> - monitors all UPnP broadcast traffic on the 
network. Solving SSDP interoperation problems has never been easier. The 
application can filter packets and issue SSDP searches, very useful for  plug fests events. </p>
<p><b>Intel Device Validator</b> - is a battery of tests that can be applied to 
any UPnP device. Validator includes tests that apply to all devices, and AV 
specific tests for AV Renderers and AV Content Directory Servers (CDS).</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Scriptor</b> - an easy to use UPnP scripting application. 
Allows the user to quickly build scenario scripts and run them against UPnP 
devices.</p>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Controller</b> - is a fully features UPnP AV Control 
Point. It is equivalent to Device Spy for AV. AV Media Controller looks for all renderers and content directories on the network, it virtualizes all of the 
media content for rapid searching, dynamically builds play lists for renderers 
that support it, supports single and multi-instance renderers and much more. 
This is the must have, UPnP AV application.</p>
<p>Additional notes on UPnP Media Controller:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on a renderer and select &quot;Renderer Controls&quot; for more renderer 
  options.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Server</b> - is complete UPnP AV Content Directory. It 
uses the file system as a database allowing the user to drag &amp; drop folders for 
quick sharing of media. Media Server's user interface also allows tracking of 
downloaded files.</p>
<p>Additional notes on&nbsp; AV Media Server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can drag &amp; drop folders onto the user interface or use the &quot;add shared 
  folder&quot; menu option.</li>
  <li>MP3 ID3 version 1 tags, GIF and JPEG metadata is supported. Other file 
  types will show up with generic metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Renderer</b> - a fully featured UPnP AV renderer running on 
Microsoft Media Player 7. Supports 
multi-instance, play lists support, complete moderated eventing, track seeking support, 
position seeking support and much more.</p>
<p>Additional notes on AV Media Renderer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run AV Media Renderer and select the features and MIME types the renderer 
  will support. Once everything is setup, select &quot;Start Renderer&quot; from the File 
  menu.</li>
  <li>Many UPnP properties including NextContentURI and many display attributes 
  don't have any effect, but are left for testing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Renderer WM9</b> - a fully featured UPnP AV renderer 
running on Microsoft Media Player 9.</p>
<p><b>Intel AV Wizard</b> - is an UPnP AV control point for playing locally 
stored content to available AV renderers. The goal if to make this application 
integrate well within Windows XP as a shell extension. Select a renderer and 
drag &amp; drop a file into AV Wizard to start playing.</p>
<p><b>Intel Network Light</b> - Also included in the package is a simple UPnP 
home automation light that can be used to demonstrate the basic abilities of 
both Device Spy and Service Author. </p>

<p><b>Intel Device Relay</b> - Mirrors UPnP Device onto a different network. 
Start Device Relay on two different computers and use a WAN interface to connect 
one to the other. UPnP Relay will automatically mirror all other devices from 
one network on to the other. Relayed devices will appear with a star (*) in 
front of their names. SSDP messages are handled locally by the relay, events and 
action invocations are forwarded to the source relay using SOAP.</p>

<p><b>Intel Micro Tools for UPnP Technologies</b> - A separate package called 
the &quot;Intel Authoring Tools for UPnP Technologies&quot; includes full source code to 
many applications. These same applications are provided as binaries in the 
&quot;Micro Tools&quot; folder. See the readme.htm in the folder for more inforamation.</p>

<p><b>Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies Java Edition</b> - Three of the most 
used tools: Intel Device Spy, Intel Device Sniffer and Intel Network Light are 
available in Java versions. See the readme.htm file in the &quot;Java Tools&quot; folder 
for more information.</p>
